# Highschool Outreach
Updates / Overview on the outreach to underrepresented groups and highschools I have set up through the club Society of Physics Students (SPS) at UCI. 
I'm very proud to be able to do this and I want to continue doing this into graduate school. Primarily, I would want to setup a program similar to Adventures in Physics. 

# Physics Journal Club??
Updates / Overview on the Physics Journal club I want to start with Luke at UCI. 
Roughly it should follow:
- Similar to a Directed Reading program. Except it will be everyone coming together, deciding a topic to learn about. 
- Then, everyone in the group will pick a specific sub topic / area to study and research on for two weeks. People will present (in lecture format), trying to teach everyone else about their area. 
- The goal is that everyone can become an "expert" on a certain part of a larger topic (say, QFT), and become a "student" on the other parts. The idea is that people will be able to feed off each other's enthusiasm / knowledge and learning will be highly accelerated
- Very similar to what Edna did at Princeton
