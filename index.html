    Welcome! <br> <br>

    A short introduction about myself:<br> 
    I am a 4th year physics major at the University of California, Irvine. I grew up in LA, where my family currently resides. Aside from physics, I am quite fond of mathematics, analytical psychology, history, and political science. It is one of my beliefs that language not just shapes our reality but directly affects our thinking and creative capabilities. I have (somewhat) organized my interests throughout this site; I hope you can enjoy them as much as I do. Thank you for reading :)

    <h4>::Psychology::</h4>
    <p>
        It is well known that Psychology is a "soft" science. What this really means is that the subject being studied is inherently extremely complex, and therefore results are difficult to verify through controlled experiments. In other words, experiments carried out in order to isolate variables are nearly impossible to repeat with consistent outcomes. Such complex structures studied would be human behavior, thought, and societal systems. Theories are then crafted through the use of observation and interpretation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        What has always fascinated me was that we know little about our brain, presumably the incredible organ that differentiates humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. My favorite psychologist is Carl Jung. A Swiss psychologist from the late 19th and early 20th century, his thoughts on the subconscious and human thought are still incredible to read today. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One question that I would like to ask is: <br>
        <i>Carl Jung, in his works, extensively discussed the plights of the individual in society and the impact of the subconscious, along with other psychological structures, in ones life. However, Jung died in 1975, before any real use of the internet publicly. Contextualize his works within the modern age. Do his findings and assertions still ring true? The bottom line is asking whether or not Jung discussed the nature of human psychology that is present no matter the era, or discussed the results that the current era he lived had on human thought. </i>

    <h4>::Artistic Expression, and Society::</h4>
    <p>One stereotype that I find interesting is the "crazy artist", namely that many famous artists are diagnosed with mental health conditions. Posed as a question, it would read like: <i>Is the crazy artist stereotype valid or not, and how does it affect individuals?</i></p>

    <p>
        I think that overall, the crazy artist stereotype is both not true and actively destructive to the larger artistic community. First and foremost, a known fallacy from statistics is that correlation does not imply causation. In this case, drawing the conclusion that "to be a great artist means you have a mental illness" from the data that may or may not positively correlate great artists with mental illness is a complete statistical fallacy. So, no, I don't think the stereotype is valid. Moreover, I think that the effect that it has on individuals is akin to "placing people in a box". If one was to believe that they needed a mental illness in order to be a great artist, then they would start forcibly carrying out actions that individuals with that mental illness exhibit. In other words, they would believe that they need to act a certain way in order to succeed. However, in my opinion, this contradicts the core principle of artistic expression! To create art, one needs to draw from their own innate, unique creativity. And, the only way to do this, is by acting like one's self. The instant that one starts fitting into stereotypical roles or categories to become a better artist, ironically, is the second that they lose the artistic edge that they have. On the flip side, for individuals already considered by themselves and/or others as "creative", this stereotype is destructive in an obvious way. Assigning a mental illness to someone who is expressing their own perspective and successful from doing so is very demeaning and dehumanizing.
