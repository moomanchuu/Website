    Welcome! <br> <br>

    A short introduction about myself:<br> 
    I am a 4th year physics major at the University of California, Irvine. I grew up in LA, where my family currently resides. While I have formally majored in the physical sciences, I am also fond of the humanities and (try to) study them in my free time. It is one of my beliefs that language not just shapes our reality but directly affects our thinking and creative capabilities. I have (somewhat) organized my interests throughout this site; I hope you can enjoy them as much as I do. Thank you for reading :)
